# DnD Encounter simulator
Simulate who would win in a Dungeons and Dragons encounter

> This is a python 3 script and is not intended to work with 2. Some folk may have made forks that do —I don't know.
> This code was my first project switching from Perl to Python, so was rather messy.
> Due to the interest I have refactored it to make it cleaner (see [changelog 0.2](change_log_0.2.md)).
> For work-in-progress see [dev branch](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-battler/tree/dev).

Welcome to the D&D 5e Encounter simulator.
It was written to determine victory probabilities and to test some hypotheses.
[An online version of the simulator](https://dnd.matteoferla.com).
    
**NB.** The server goes down occassionally —primarily due to the fact that if a request times out the encounter simulation continues.    
So if it is down, please feel free to email matteo dot ferla at gmail.com and I'll reboot it.
**NB.** A repository of the server is available [here](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-encounter-simulator-site).

## Unfinished

This module is not pip released because it was never finished —the main branch will be stable though.
Two big requests are to make the combat on a grid,
and the other make the tactics trained —the logic is conditionals based atm. Also the code became quickly sprawling so
I started doing a refactor two years ago and I have only given it 2-3 hours since because work projects,
 work-related projects, other projects (like a Raspberry Pi Furby) and real life take more of my free time.

## Monster manual
The simulator relies on  creature information present in the `beastiary.csv` file. This file was kindly compiled by Jeff Fox.
It contains all creature present in the D&D 5e SDR and is distributed under the following licence:

#Documentation
This module allows the simulation of a D&D encounter.
It has three main classes:  Dice (and its derivatives), Character, Encounter.
It also has a csv file (`beastiary.csv`) containing all 5e SDR monsters.

**Teams.** Multiple creatures of the same alignment will team up to fight creatures of different alignments in a simulation (`Encounter().battle()` for a single iteration or `Encounter().go_to_war()` for multiple).
**Gridless.** The game assumes everyone is in contact with everyone and not on a grid. The reason being is tactics.
**Tactics.** Tactics are highly problematic both in targetting and actions to take. Players do not play as strategically as they should due to heroism and kill tallies, while the DM might play monsters really dumbly to avoid a TPK.
**Targetting.** The simulator is set up as a munchkin combat where everyone targets the weakest opponent (The global variable `TARGET="enemy alive weakest"` makes the `find_weakest_target` method of the `Encounter` be used, but could be changed (unwisely) to a permutation of enemy/ally alive/dead weakest/random/fiercest.
The muchkinishness has a deleterious side-effect when the method deathmatch of the Encounter class is invoked —this allocates each Creature object in the Encounter object to a different team.
**Actions.** Action choice is dictated by turn economy. A character of a team with the greater turn economy will dodge (if it knows itself a target) or throw a net (if it has one), and so forth while a creature on the opposed side will opt for a slugfest.

```
>>> from DnD_battler import Creature, Encounter
>>> Creature.load('aboleth') # get from beastiary
>>> level1 = Creature(name="buff peasant", abilities = {'str': 15,'dex': 14,'con':13,'int':12,'wis':10,'cha': 8}, alignment ="good", attack_parameters=['longsword'])
>>> billybob = Creature(name = "lich")
>>> billybob.alignment = "good"  #the name of the alignment means only what team name they are in.  
>>> arena = DnD.Encounter(level1, 'badger')  #Encounter accepts both Creature and strings.
>>> print(arena.go_to_war(10000)) #simulate 10,000 times
>>> print(arena.battle()) # simulate one encounter and tell what happens.
>>> print(Creature.load('tarrasque').generate_character_sheet())  #md character sheet.
>>> print(Encounter.load("ancient blue dragon").addmob(85).go_to_war(10))  #An ancient blue dragon is nearly a match for 85 commoners (who crit evenutally)...
```

## Creature: parameters and attributes

The creature class can be started from scratch or from a monster from the manual:

```python
from DnD_battler import Creature
Creature()
Creature.load('commoner')
```
Both accept several arguments. 

```python
from DnD_battler import Creature
Creature(name="Achilles", alignment='Achaeans')
Creature.load(creature_name='commoner', name="Achilles", alignment='Achaeans')
```

Technically, these are set via `apply_parameters`. These are:

* _name_ (`str`) name of creature for logs, stored in `creature.name`
* _base_ (`str`) No longer accepted as parameter. Please use ``Creature.load(creature_name)``.
    The attribute ``.base`` is just a keepsake, altering does nothing.
* _xp_ (`int`) Experience points, does nothing. Stored in `creature.xp`.
* _size_ (`str`) sets the size. Note the attribute `creature.size` is a Size instance. alter `.size.name` for effects.
* _alignment_ (`str`) not quite the alignment but the side in the encounter.
    In future I **may** split these and use alignment to determine side.
* _arena_ (`Encounter`) the encounter object itself. Stored in `creature.arena`.
* _level_ (`int`) the level. Stored in `creature.level`, but use `set_level` to alter 
    and it affects the `.proficiency` attribute.
* _proficiency_ (`int`) the proficiency bonus, however, the `.proficiency` attribute is a `Proficiency` instance.
    the `.proficiency.bonus` attribute is the bonus. It scales automatically with level.
* _hd_ (`int`) hit dice number of faces. Alters `.hit_die.num_faces`. Trigger hp recalculation if no hp specified.
* _hp_ (`int`) hit points. Note this is calculated automatically otherwise. `.hp` is the current `.hp`,
    `.starting_hp` is the pre-battle one.
* _abilities_ (`dict`), _ability_bonuses_ (`dict`), _str_ (`int`), _dex_ (`int`) etc. `ab_str` (`int`) etc.: 
    _abilities_ and _ability_bonuses_ are potentially incomplete dict of 3-letter ability and score/bonus. 
    3-letter ability take precedence. Bonus takes precedence over score
    (note that if a mismatching score/bonus is given the score will be kept
    and not corrected —it has no effect.
    The abilities are stored as 3-letter attributes with a unique `Ability` die. Proficiency is already added.
    so `creature.str.bonus` is the bonus, `creature.str.temp_modifier` is a temp modifier and
    `creature.str.score` is the score. Note that derived abilities, such as attack rolls and skill checks
    (`AttackRoll` and `SkillRoll`) are dependent on this die, so change the properties as opposed to setting a new one.
    This allows AttackRolls to have a weapon-specific attack bonus (in addition to a damage bonus) which gets added to
    a `.proficiency.bonus`, `ability_die.temp_modifier` and `ability_die.bonus`.
* _initiative_bonus_ (`int`): this alters the `.initiative.modifier` as `initiative` is a `SkillRoll`.
    
## Dice

The `Dice` object is easy. It has `.num_faces`, a `.bonus` and a `.avg` boolean flag which controls whether rolls are 
always an average (NPC style). The method `roll` rolls the dice and adds the bonus (`base_roll` does not). 

Then `Ability` extends this by taking into account `Proficiency` stored in the `.proficiency` attribute.
`temp_modifier` and taking account of advantage. `score` does nothing really.

Then `SkillRoll` wraps around an ability die adding a `modifier`. Note that `bonuses` (plural) 
gives the sum of the bonuses. The attribute `bonus` is not used.
Altering an ability die will automatically affect the dependent skill rolls.

Then `AttackRoll` extends `SkillRoll` further and has a bound damage dice. `attack` against an AC value
rolls and returns damage.

## Logging

The module uses a shared `logging.Logger` with a `sys.stdout` stream set to `logging.INFO`.

```python
from DnD_battler import Creature, log

log is Creature.log
```

Therefore, alter the logging to a different handler if needed as per usual.

```python
from DnD_battler import log
import logging, io

# change the default...
log.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # logging.DEBUG = 20
# add a new one.
stream = io.StringIO('started')
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream)
handler.set_name('stream')
handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
log.addHandler(handler)
log.info('Next battle!')
```

## Note on altering methods

The behaviour of a Creature is dictated by `act()` class method.
Specifically, the simulations runs _n_ encounters via `Encounter(<...>).go_to_war(n)_`, which runs `.battle()` _n_ times. The latter method iterates across the creatures running their `Creature().act()` method, which makes them decide whether to heal, dodge, attack, free themselves, buff, throw net etc. The attack is called `.multiattack()`
If you want to override the behaviour of say a creature to attack regardlessly and at random you can change the class's method `act()`

```
import random, DnD, types

donald=Creature("Donald", alignment='Murica')
kim=DnD.Creature("Kim",alignment='NKorea')
rex=DnD.Creature.load(creature_name="owlbear", name="Rex", alignment='Murica', int=1, wis=1)

# new method
def trumpconomy(self, assess=0):
    if not self.arena.find('alive enemy') and len(self.arena.find('alive ally')) == 1: #TrumpMod: Win when all bar one.
        raise Encounter.Victory()
    for i in range(len(self.attacks)):
        try:
            opponent = random.choice([other for other in self.arena.combattants if other is not self]) #TrumpMod kill all bar self.
        except IndexError:
            raise self.arena.Victory()
        self.log.debug(self.name + ' attacks ' + opponent.name + ' with ' + str(self.attacks[i]['name']))
        # This was the hit method. put here for now.
        self.attacks[i]['attack'].advantage = self.check_advantage(opponent)
        if self.attacks[i]['attack'].roll() >= opponent.ac:
            # self.attacks[i]['damage'].crit = self.attacks[i]['attack'].crit  #Pass the crit if present.
            h = self.attacks[i]['damage'].roll()
            opponent.take_damage()
            self.tally['damage'] += h
            self.tally['hits'] += 1
        else:
            self.tally['misses'] += 1


# adding the unbound method as a bound method...
donald.act=types.MethodType(trumpconomy, donald)

Encounter(donald,rex,kim).battle()
```

In round one Donald attacks his ally Rex, thus proving the behavior is altered.


# Class summary
## Dice
Dice accepts bonus plus an int —8 is a d8— or a list of dice —[6,6] is a 2d6— or nothing —d20.
    roll() distinguishes between a d20 and not. d20 crits have to be passed manually.
## Character
Character has a boatload of attributes. It can be initialised with a dictionary or an unpacked one... or a single name matching a preset.
## Encounter
Encounter includes the following method:
    battle(reset=1) does a single battle (after a reset of values if asked). it calls a few other fuctions such as roll_for_initiative()
    go_to_war(rounds=1000) performs many battles and gives the team results


There is some code messiness resulting from the unclear distinction between Encounter and Creature object, namely
a Creature interacting with another is generally a Creature method, while a Creature searching across the list of Creatures in the Encounter is an Encounter method.

There are one or two approximations that are marked `#NOT-RAW`. In the Encounter.battle method there are some thought on the action choices.



# class Creature(builtins.object)
Creature class handles the creatures and their actions and some interactions with the encounter.

# class Encounter(builtins.object)
In a dimensionless model, move action and the main actions dash, disengage, hide, shove back/aside, tumble and overrun are meaningless.
weapon attack —default
two-weapon attack —
    Good when the opponent has low AC (<12) if 2nd attack is without proficiency.
    Stacks with bonuses such as sneak attack or poisoned weapons -neither are in the model.
    Due to the 1 action for donning/doffing a shield, switch to two handed is valid for unshielded folk only.
    Best keep two weapon fighting as a prebuild not a combat switch.
AoE spell attack — Layout…
targetted spell attack —produce flame is a cantrip so could be written up as a weapon. The bigger ones. Spell slots need to be re-written.
spell buff —Barkskin is a druidic imperative. Haste? Too much complication.
spell debuff —Bane…
dodge —targeted and turn economy
help —high AC target (>18), turn economy, beefcake ally
ready —teamwork preplanning. No way.
grapple/climb —very situational. grapple/shove combo or barring somatic.
disarm —disarm… grey rules about whether picking it up or kicking it away is an interact/move/bonus/main action.
    netting is a better option albeit a build.
called shot —not an official rule. Turn economy.
