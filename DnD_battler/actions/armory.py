These "weapons" are attacks, not weapons per se.
They are bound to a creature.

The idea is that beyond the standard weapons more exotic ones can be added.
Finesse is a quality that springs to mind.

TODO the standard weapons will be loaded from a JSON or a CSV file.
 for now, they are hardcoded here temporarily.
